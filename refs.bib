    abstract  = {A robust method for estimating the parameters of a regression model with ARIMA errors is presented. The estimates are defined by the minimization of a conveniently robustified likelihood function. This robustification is achieved by replacing in the reduced form of the Gaussian likelihood function the mean square error of the standardized residuals by the square of a robust scale estimate of standardized filtered residuals. The robust filtering procedure avoids the propagation of the effect of one outlier on several subsequent residuals. Computational aspects of these estimates are discussed and the results of a Monte Carlo study are presented.},

    abstract = {{The order, (p, q), of an autoregressive-moving average sequence, y(t), may be estimated by minimizing a criterion, log σ^2+(p+q)logT/T with respect to p and q, where  is the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance of the innovations, ε(t). It is suggested that, instead, be estimated from a series of regressions of y(t) on y(t-1),y(t-2),…,y(t-p),ɛ^(t-1),…ɛ^(t-q), where the  (t) are obtained by fitting a long autoregression to the data. It is shown how the sequence of regressions may, for p = q, be economically recursively calculated by embedding them in a sequence of bivariate autoregressions. Asymptotic properties of the procedure are established under very general conditions.}},

@article{HarveyPhillips1979,
    abstract  = {The regression model with autoregressive-moving average disturbances may be cast in a form suitable for the application of Kalman filtering techniques. This enables the generalized least squares estimator to be calculated without evaluating and inverting the covariance matrix of the disturbances. The problem of forecasting future values of the dependent variable is also effectively solved when the Kalman filter technique is applied. Furthermore, the properties of the residuals produced by the filter suggest that they may be useful for diagnostic checking of the model. The Kalman filter algorithm also forms the basis of a method for the exact maximum likelihood estimation of the model. This may well have computational, as well as theoretical, advantages over other methods.},
